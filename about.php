<h1>About</h1>


<p>My name is Dima. I'm a young tattoo artist who has recently moved to Toronto from Sochi, Russia. I have completed a tattooing course in Krasnodar, Russia. After returning home, I did tattooing for one year. At the moment I'm working on my own but would like to start work at a salon as I feel I could use the platform for getting my work out there as it is my specialty; I'm ready to work full time. I can tattoo many styles. I especially prefer dotwork and black and white work.</p>

<p>For the past five years, I have been improving my painting skills and changing my painting styles. I attended school for painting for three years while in Russia. I have sold some pieces in Russia and am interested in selling more of my pieces here in Toronto. I am also looking to be represented by an agent who can assist in getting my work into galleries.</p>

<p>I have been working on my sketches, using more colour, and my shading. I really enjoy drawing and doing graphic design as well. Iâ€™m influenced by the places, things, and cultures that I have experienced throughout my travels, as well as my social interactions with new people.</p>

<p>If you are interested in my portfolio, please contact me at +1-437-992-9796 or <a href='mailto:tatttodavidjunk@gmail.com'>tatttodavidjunk@gmail.com</a>. I am open to a variety of opportunities.</p>
